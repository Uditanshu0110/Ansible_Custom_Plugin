# Ansible_Custom_Plugin



## This is Custom Ansible Filter Plugin through which we can List all the Top Level Base Folders in the S3 bucket on the top of the AWS cloud.

Filter plugins manipulate data. They are a feature of Jinja2 and are also available in Jinja2 templates used by the template module. As with all plugins, they can be easily extended, but instead of having a file for each one you can have several per file. Most of the filter plugins shipped with Ansible reside in a core.py.

Filter plugins do not use the standard configuration.
